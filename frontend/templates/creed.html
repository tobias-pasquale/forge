    <p>I act from purpose, not for permission.<br>
    I seek truth, not applause.<br>
    Outcomes are data, not definitions.<br>
    <br>
    Victory humbles me. <br>
    Failure instructs me. <br>
    Neither owns me.<br>
    <br>
    I do not beg reality to favor me.<br>
    I build until reality yields.<br>
    <br>
    I welcome pressure.<br>
    I refine through friction.<br>
    I sharpen through solitude.<br>
    <br>
    I am not owed success.<br>
    I earn alignment between what I build and what I become.<br>
    <br>
    Each task is a brick.<br>
    Each decision is a hammer strike.<br>
    I forge myself, daily, without guarantee, without mercy, without end.</p>
